CLI QUESTION:

Sunil's Configuration Adventure 💻✨

Sunil, a new software developer, has been assigned a crucial task: setting up configuration files for a new project. But there's a twist—he's on a mission to organize and manage the files like a ninja! 🐱‍💻

Help Sunil navigate the project folder, make key modifications, and keep everything organized. Ready? Let’s go!


Folder Structure:

project/
│
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── logo.png
│   │   └── banner.jpg
│   └── styles/
│       └── main.css
│
├── docs/
│   ├── readme.txt
│   └── changelog.txt
│
├── src/
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── config.js
│   └── helpers.js
│
└── logs/
    ├── error.log
    └── access.log
Instructions:
Create a new folder named packages inside the project directory and a file named package.json inside the packages directory.
Rewrite the config file (config.js) in the src folder so that it only contains the text "Configuration Files".
Add a log entry to access.log present inside the logs folder, stating "End of Application Logs". (You have to append the given text to the file)
Move the helpers file (helpers.js) into a new folder named helpers inside the project directory.
Finally, delete the docs folder to clean up the project space. 🧹
Each step you complete gets Sunil closer to becoming the code wizard of his team! 

Note:

Please make sure that you are right inside the project directory before running the code.
Ignore the run file which is already present in the root directory.
