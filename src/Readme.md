## How It Works

The program uses the following steps to generate greetings:

1. **User Input**: Prompts the user for their name and preferences.
2. **Greeting Generation**: Based on the current time and chosen language, the program constructs an appropriate greeting.
3. **Timezone Handling**: Utilizes the `pytz` library to handle time zones and ensure the correct local time is used.
4. **Logging**: Writes the greeting message to a log file for future reference.
